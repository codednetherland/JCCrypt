[purpose]
This is a programm and library to create encrypted containers with
asymmetric or symmetric keys. It is meant to make safe data exchange
easier.
I will try to make a possibility to mount them directly via FUSE.

[licence]
This is licencend under GNU General Public Licence 3 or later. For
further details please see the file COPING.txt shipped with this or
alternatively you can look it up here: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/

[version]
Until the tag 1.0 there will occur major changes.
Later on I want to only bugfix and implement new features till 2.0.

[tests]
If somebody wants to make unit tests with JUnit or so I would really
appreciate it. Maybe some time I will have enough time and make them.
